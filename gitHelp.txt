Before start using git!
There are 3 stages in git.
1. (Brown color) Untracked, non added or modified - when you have files that was changed or deleted or created. Any changes that you can imagine.
2. (Green color) Index status or stage status - when you add changed files to index or stage status by "git add filename" command
3. (No color) Succesfully added to git (commit) - when you add staged or index files to git by using git "commit filename"
It's local changes not server!!!

After git commit you can upload changes to server by using git push (see all more about git push below)

https://git-scm.com/download/win                   ----> download git 

Create directory (folder) and open git bash in this folder

git init                                           ----> initialize git in your directory
git config user.name "Kolpaxidis V. (home PC)"     ----> configure git by adding your name
git config user.email kolpaxidis86@gmail.com       ----> configure git by adding your email

git status                                         ----> check file status

git log                                            ----> show commits

git add                                            ----> add file as tracked (add file to git)
git add .                                          ----> add all file as tracked (add all file to git)
git add file.js                                    ----> add file as tracked by name
git add folder/file.js                             ----> add file as tracked by name in folder

git commit                                         ----> add commit
git commit -m "Test message"                       ----> add commit with message

git diff index.html                                ----> show changes

git mv main.js js/                                 ----> move file from root folder to js folder
git mv js/main.js ./                               ----> move file from js folder to root folder
git mv index.html main.html                        ----> change file name (git mv existingFileName newFileName)
git mv js/main.html ./test.js                      ----> move main.html file from js folder to root folder and rename it to test.js (fatality!!!)

git restore abc.js                                 ----> restore file from last commit (first add file and commit it !)

git rm abc.js                                      ----> delete abc.js file and goes root to index (or stage status)
git restore --staged abc.js                        ----> restore prev status with abc.js in directory
git restore
